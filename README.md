# webdev-class
A repository containing all the pages written for my Web Development class, rewritten slightly to work together as a website.

Some of the pages have been modified slightly to be more cohesive, but none of the content has changed.

There are 2 additions:
- A new landing page to describe the website.
- A disclaimer page for my final project section of the website.
